# Personal Website

A simple personal website using React frontend containerized with Docker.

DISCLAIMER: This website was built by AI. Initial template was generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and polished by Qwen2.5-coder:14b using Continue extension in VS Code. 

My role in this project is AI prompting, adding content, dockerizing and deploying the app.

My goal here is to see how well AI is able to create a website for me (someone with zero web dev experience). At the same time I want to learn web development by going through the AI-generated codebase, and also learn about reverse proxy tools like nginx.

## Features

- Responsive personal website with Home, Projects, and Contact pages
- React frontend with React Router for navigation
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- For development - install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- If on Windows, WSL

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd personal-website
   ```

2. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker compose up -d (deploy current image)
   docker compose up -d --build react-frontend (to rebuild image)
   ```

3. Access the website at http://localhost

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode:

#### Frontend

```
cd personal-website
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the React development server at http://localhost:3000.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - React Router
  - Axios for API requests
  - CSS for styling
  - Tailwind CSS for styling (configured in `tailwind.config.js` and processed by `postcss.config.js`)

- **Deployment:**
  - Docker
  - Nginx (for serving the frontend)
